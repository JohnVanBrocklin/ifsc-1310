      <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
      <h3>Progressive Enhancement is the progress of making sure that things are done in order to ensure stability. An example of this is making sure that a machine displays in order from html, css, and then js, and makes sure that it loads correctly on different machines and broswers. This is important because it makes sure that users aren't given something that is broken. <blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/the-mighty-programmer/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a">"What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it matters?"</a></blockquote></h3>

      <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection Assignment (FINAL)</h3>
      <h3><p>I had a lot of fun this semester considering Ive never really coded before and it was a  little overwhelming at times. Things that I did do well was learning that I need to practice over and over and that was really the only way to learn. Next, things that I would do differently would be to learn to make sure that you have things the way that you want them before you push them to Github, and also before you move on to another assignment. This just makes the Github homepage look cleaner with the right commit phrase.</p>

          <p>I was told that it might look better with more pictures. So what I did was add a JQuery library and use the cycle lab as an example and add my own pictures. This gives it a unique feel to make sure its not so boring. I also fixed my pictures to make sure thay have a alt function so screen readers would read it to people who need to use them. I also resized the pictures to make sure they look a little better.</p>
